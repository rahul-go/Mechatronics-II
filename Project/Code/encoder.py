	## Constructor for the encoder driver.
	#
	#  The constructor is called by passing the pin objects (as a list)
	#  corresponding to the encoder, the corresponding timer ID, and the
	#  corresponding channels (as a list). The channels should be passed with
	#  respect to the order in which the pins objects were passed.
	#  Corresponding pins, timers, and channels can be found in the user manual
	#  of the microcontroller.
	#      
	#  @param pins Pin objects for the encoder are passed as a list to specify
	#  the pins to which the physical encoder is attached.
	#
	#  @param timer Timer ID that corresponds to the pins being used. Refer to
	#  the user manual of the microcontroller to determine the correct timer
	#  ID.
	#
	#  @param channels Channels that correspond to the pins. The channels
	#  should be passed with with respect to the order in which the pins
	#  objects were passed. Refer to the user manual of the microcontroller to
	#  to determined the correct channel for each pin.

	## Gets the encoder's traveled distance.
	#
	#  The "read()" function is used to return the distance traveled by the
	#  motor in units of encoder ticks, as well as the velocity, which is in 
	#  units of encoder ticks/second. The function handles underflow and
	#  overflow in the 16-bit timer counter by calculating the more likely
	#  direction of travel in the case of large changes in value. This is most
	#  effective and accurate when the read function is called quickly enough.
	#  "Quickly" is determined as a function of motor speed; a motor spinning
	#  more quickly will require the read() function to be called more
	#  frequently for underflow/overflow to be handled properly.
