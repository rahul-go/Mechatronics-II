## @file controller.py
#  The controller module contains the Controller class.
#
#  The controller class is a general proportional controller. The 
#  initialization consists of setting a proportional gain and setpoint. The 
#  controller must then be repeatedly called and given a measurement of the 
#  value being controlled. The controller will then return a value to be 
#  output to the controller. As an added functionality, the controller 
#  records its time and output.
