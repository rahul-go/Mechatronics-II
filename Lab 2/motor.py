	## Constructor for motor driver
	#
	#  Creates a motor driver by initializing GPIO pins and turning the motor
	#  off for safety. The constructor is called by passing the pin objects (as
	#  a list) corresponding to the motor, the corresponding timer ID, and the
	#  corresponding channels (as a list). The channels should be passed with
	#  respect to the order in which the pins objects were passed.
	#  Corresponding pins, timers, and channels can be found in the user manual
	#  of the microcontroller.
	#      
	#  @param pins Pin objects for the motor are passed as a list to specify
	#  the pins to which the physical motor is attached. The first pin object
	#  in the list corresponds to the first input pin, the second pin object 
	#  corresponds to the second input pin, and the third pin object
	#  correspond to the enable pin.
	#
	#  @param timer Timer ID that corresponds to the pins being used. Refer to
	#  the user manual of the microcontroller to determine the correct timer
	#  ID.
	#
	#  @param channels Channels that correspond to the pins. The first channel
	#  in the list corresponds to the first input pin, and the second channel
	#  corresponds to the second input pin. Refer to the user manual of the
	#  microcontroller to determined the correct channel for each pin.

	#
	#  This method sets the duty cycle to be sent
	#  to the motor to the given level. Positive values
	#  cause torque in one direction, negative values
	#  in the opposite direction.
	#

	#  cycle of the voltage sent to the motor.
